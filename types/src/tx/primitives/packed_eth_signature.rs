/// Struct used for working with ethereum signatures created using eth_sign (using geth, ethers.js, etc)
/// message is serialized as 65 bytes long `0x` prefixed string.
///
/// Some notes on implementation of methods of this structure:
///
/// Ethereum signed message produced by most clients contains v where v = 27 + recovery_id(0,1,2,3),
/// but for some clients v = recovery_id(0,1,2,3).
/// Library that we use for signature verification (written for bitcoin) expects v = recovery_id
///
/// That is why:
/// 1) when we create this structure by deserialization of message produced by user
/// we subtract 27 from v in `ETHSignature` if necessary and store it in the `ETHSignature` structure this way.
/// 2) When we serialize/create this structure we add 27 to v in `ETHSignature`.
///
/// This way when we have methods that consumes &self we can be sure that ETHSignature::recover_signer works
/// And we can be sure that we are compatible with Ethereum clients.
